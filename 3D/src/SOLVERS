Solvers supported by the main code and tools for analysis
=========================================================

0. I/O and FFT libraries
========================

All the solvers and analysis tools work with the following parallel 
FFT libraries (pass 'FFTP=' to the make command to change the default):

   fftp-3 parallel FFT library to link with FFTW 3.x [DEFAULT]
   fftp-2 parallel FFT library to link with FFTW 2.x

and with the following I/O libraries (pass 'IOLIB=' to change the 
default):

   mpiio  MPI I/O, one file for all processors [DEFAULT]
   posix  posix I/O, one file per processor
